# chart-api
Open source standalone application to generate charts generically.

## how it works?
You just need to send a ajax request with well-formatted json (powered by http://www.chartjs.org/docs) to this application url and show the result.

When you access the root application url, you can see a usage example for all charts available.

```
  git clone https://github.com/rihjsantos/chart-api.git
  cd chart-api
  composer install
  php artisan serve
```
access ```http://localhost:8000/``` and see the usage
